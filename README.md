# Universal Verification Methodology of a simple Serial Transceiver
This project describes the design of a simple Serial Transceiver and also the verification of this design with the help of the UVM.

## Instructions
This repository contains two SystemVerilog scripts, one for the [design](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Memory_UVM/blob/main/Design.sv) of the memory and one for the [verification](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Memory_UVM/blob/main/Testbench.sv) of this design. Also contain a [.txt](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Memory_UVM/blob/main/Verification_Memory.txt) file in witch you cand see the functionability of this project on EDa Playground.
